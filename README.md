## Projects

__Kyiv news parser__ [repo](https://github.com/danvoronov/cityNewsParser)

üß∞ Node.js with NLP libs, RSS Aggregation, Telegram Bot API, Heroku & GitHub deploy.

We made an automation that collect rus lang news from a variety of sources (google news, RSS feeds, telegram publics) for a given city. Then news with certain keywords are removed from DB. To the rest are assigned a rating of their constructiveness (sentiment analysis). News with a high rating are automatically published to Telegram thru bot.
